For the array assignment, we had to create a program that would turn a random pwm led on with a random brightness every second, and if one was chosen twice it would turn off.
One tip to myself for this assignment would be to utilize the boolean array earlier.

The paper prototype for my final project is displayed below and features all circuitry on the front of the design so the back can be utilized for art.
The battery component of the shirt is so that all of the components can be powered.
