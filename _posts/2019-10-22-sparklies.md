The assignment for the week was for us to program all three of the previous sparklies onto one board so that they happen simultaneously.
Each of the sparklies had its own pin so that they would all illuminate at the same time with their respective flash.

One thing I would suggest for my past self is to comment better on the code so I can keep track of it with more ease.
