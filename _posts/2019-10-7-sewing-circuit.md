The assignment for the weekend for us to use our sewing sampler and create a circuit with a switch with conductive fabric and a conductive thread with a satin stitch. We used our old sewing samplers for this project. 

One tip for past me for this assignment would be to be more consistent with my stitches so that the connection is more constant.
