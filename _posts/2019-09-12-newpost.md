My name is Paul Harshbarger and I am from Saratoga Springs, NY. I am currently a first year here and I hope to major in either Physics or Economics. I have almost no sewing experience and no real programming experience either. In this class I hope I learn how to do some basic programming such as website building, and give me a foundation to take an upper level CompSci course.
