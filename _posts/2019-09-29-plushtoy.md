The assignment for us this weekend was to create a plush toy wired with three LED lights, a switch, and a button. 

The purpose of the switch and button is to control electron flow to the LEDs such that they can be turned on and off with them.

One thing I suggest as a tip/trick is to test the plushy multiple time before sewing because I ended up re-sewing the plushy numerous times. I would also suggest going to the TA hours or office hours for help with the circuitry because I didn't and should have. 

Another tip or trick I would suggest is to use more than two pieces of conductive thread so that there is a break in the circuit for the button and switch. I used two pieces of thread and that is why my switch and button were not effective because the current went right through them without taking heed of either's ability, per se.
