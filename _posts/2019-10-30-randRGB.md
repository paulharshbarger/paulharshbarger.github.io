This week's assignment was for us to program the arduino center light (12,13,14) to randomly generate a pigment value for each to combine to form a new color each time the button is pressed. When the button is pressed, the light illuminates with a new color and when turns off when the button is released.

One thing I would suggest for my past self is to use anolog and digital write in the right spots.
