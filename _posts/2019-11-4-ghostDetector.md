The assignment was for us to program our arduino to turn on red lights when the temperature was below a certain value and the light was darker than a certain value.
When both are true all the red lights turn on and when they're not none of the lights are on.

One tip for past me for this assignment would be more aware of the conversion code to make the code more concise.
