The assignment tonight was for us to program a menu using nested if statements, such that if a customer chooses an odd or even number they will be given a secret or regular menu.
One tip for past me for this assignment would be to read through the slides from class before starting the assignment because that would be a nice referesher on the material gone over during the day.
