The following facts are about me:

- I am a student at Williams College
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- I eat food almost three times every day

My username is paul.harshbarger

I am taking this electronic textile class because I want to have a foundation for programming skills that will be valuable in the future and have the knowledge to sew clothing for myself when it rips or I need something to fit with more precision. This class is the perfect combination of the two!
### I am thankful for you visiting my website!
