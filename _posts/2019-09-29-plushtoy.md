The assignment for us this weekend was to create a plush toy wired with three LED lights, a switch, and a button. 

The purpose of the switch and button is to control electron flow to the LEDs such that they can be turned on and off with them.

One thing I suggest as a tip/trick is to test the plushy multiple time before sewing because I ended up re-sewing the plushy numerous times. I would also suggest going to the TA hours or office hours for help with the circuitry because I didn't and should have.
