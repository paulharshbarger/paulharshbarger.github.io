The Star Shirt is not something one will see often, unless in the presence of the lucky man named Aidan who will be sporting
the shirt at ALL social functions. The motivation behind the piece was always having difficulty finding Aidan when we are out 
and I want people to understand how much of a star he is. In addition, I feel as though people may consider me a young, technological, 
Ralph Lauren. This shirt is designed to light up and flash to the tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" while it plays in the background
when the temperature and brightness warrant it, and the switch is on. If the correct brightness and temperature aren't met, the lights will flash
in a unique pattern. If the switch is off, nothing will happen. 

This has been a painful process, so one of the tips to my past self would be to have a more level head and use more mental toughness when 
tackling a project of this magnitude. In addition, I would suggest biting off little pieces of the sewing each day instead of doing it all
within 2 days. Finally, I would tell myself to be more careful on connecting the components and use my aligator clip prototype for reference 
more often.
