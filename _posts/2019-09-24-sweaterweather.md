This assignment was to create a series of "if" statements that respond to the temperature variable by displaying a message.
Oftentimes the message was a suggestion of what to wear, but sometimes it was merely a comment or suggestion about an action that might be helpful.
In this assignment we utilized "if", "else if", and "else" statements that responded to the temperature.

One thing I suggest as a tip/trick is to take one piece of code I did and copy/paste it where need be and just change the text and variables to make it applicable instead of writing it all from scratch to avoid errors.
